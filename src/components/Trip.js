          text="Kedarkantha (not to be confused with the popular Temple Kedarnath) is a 6-day long trek in Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Uttarakhand (6 when including the travel days from Dehradun to the base camp and back).
           Kedarkantha is easily one of the most popular treks in India â€” popular amongst seasoned trekkers and beginners alike.
           There are many reasons why it is a very popular trek to do in the Indian Himalayas.  
           The third biggest reason this trek is unique is its beautiful forests.  All three routes have beautiful diverse forests that will immerse you.  
           If you are not careful, you will get lost in them (in a good way)."
